When software developer  start to select  the a software protection tools to protect their project. Besides of testing and evaluating the security performance of software protection tools: features , functions, easy of use, those traditional security features, another criteria, usually  for most of software developer focused and concerned is:

**On Premise Tool or Cloud Service?**

Nowadays, many software vendor provides their software or software service via cloud service, based on public cloud, private cloud or hybrid cloud, with SaaS, offering flexible service mode, user may customized the service offering with flexible subscription time,  feature and version by themselves, many software user prefer to find relevant service offering via cloud service and no need to invest and purchase software and maintain on user premise which to save Capex., human resource to maintain the system. etc.

Some of software protection vendors also offer the encryption, protection and hardening service via cloud. so developer may select the code/project protection service by self defined subscription period, or even by  the No. of software package be protected. to save the time, cost or other investment in software protection/hardening field. 

To complete code protection via cloud service, it is also much helpful to these developer without rich experience in code protection and encryption area, you just need to upload your project to the cloud platform and select and set several encryption features to specified functions, classes, or the file you want to protect: Obfuscation, name of obfuscation, Virtualization. Compression.  then leave rest of thing to the cloud platform to follow up. The code of protection or encryption becomes so easily and quickly via cloud service, everybody will become encryption expert and to complete the code of protection and hardening work in minutes, even without encryption experience. 

### **Code Protection process via Cloud Service**

Usually, for these online cloud protection service. the cloud protection process  could be like this:

Software developer required to upload their software project, source code, or built project files: .exe, dll, .so, Apk, AAB, AAR file to the cloud, so the cloud service will read, encrypt your project code and return the protected package back to you.  Then developer can use the protected package to distribute or launch the package to the software users.

Compare with On-Premise solution, Using Cloud Protection service to instead of traditional On Premise Solution,  the most of the concern from software developer will be:

1. Developer has to upload the source code or original project file to cloud platform to encrypt. it may  increase project code leaking risk to third party. even every cloud service provider commit they will not retain the software project upload to their service platform. since most of service provide use the third party cloud service platform. 

2. For Most of ISV, according to company policy, R & D engineer are not allowed to upload source code, project to outside platform for additional service to avoid code leaking. In some cases, it is even not to allowed to access Internet for R &D dept. They all work in offline environment to avoid code breach.  So for most of ISV who want to find code protection solution, Cloud service may not to be optional when they select and put it in  the evaluation shortlist. 
3. Some of developer may have strictly policy, law or regulation defined all of data, resource which project contained and related may strictly control and not allowed to upload to cloud  to prevent from data breach and leak.
